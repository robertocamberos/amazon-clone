# Amazon Clone
A fully-functional e-commerce website that works and looks like amazon. Some features of the application include being able to login into an account, search for items through a search bar, filter items by category, sort based on price as well as reviews, being able to add items to an online cart and check out those items using a third-party payment processor like PayPal or 
Stripe.
